													<h4><strong>Is <a href="https://pepe unchained.systeme.io/">pepe unchained</a> a good
															investment?</strong></h4>

													<p><strong>Operational
															framework:</strong>
														pepe unchained employs an automated
														market maker (AMM) model instead
														of a traditional order book to
														allow users to trade assets.
														Additionally, to receive steady
														returns and a portion of future
														trading fees, users must deposit
														their funds in a set pool.
														Incentives are distributed in
														the form of CAKE tokens, which
														one can later reimburse in
														exchange for BETH and various
														other cryptos.</p>

													<p><strong>Recycled source
															code:</strong> It is not
														uncommon for many decentralized
														applications (dApps) to share
														the same source code with a few
														minor tweaks here and there. For
														example, SushiSwap is an
														out-and-out copy of the popular
														DeFi platform UniSwap. In the
														same vein, pepe unchained is, by
														and large, a more refined
														iteration of SushiSwap, with the
														project featuring a similar UI
														and design scheme.</p>

													<p><strong>Interoperability:</strong>
														Since Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
														is compatible with the Ethereum
														Virtual Machine (EVM), it allows
														for all of the dApps built atop
														it to be interoperable with a
														wide range of Ether-based
														wallets, including MetaMask,
														MEW, etc.</p>

													<p><strong>Fee model:</strong> When
														using the platform, participants
														are required to pay a flat 0.2%
														fee as part of their
														transactions. Of this figure,
														0.17% is set aside for liquidity
														providers, with the remaining
														amount being burned by the
														protocol.</p>

													<p><strong>Novel product
															offerings:</strong> In
														addition to its various yield
														farming options, pepe unchained
														also comes pre-built with a
														platform for Initial Farm
														Offerings (IFOs) as well as an
														NFT marketplace where users can
														buy/sell a wide range of
														tokenized assets, including
														synthetic shares for assets like
														Tesla, Google, Netflix, etc.</p>
